### Creating Taco Challenge:

1. Create a new class called `Taco`.
2. The `Taco` class should have a constructor method that sets a default `type`
   property to "chicken", a default `spiciness` property to "mild", and a
   default `toppings` property to an empty array.
3. The `Taco` class should have a method called `addTopping` that accepts a
   `topping` argument and adds it to the `toppings` array.
4. The `Taco` class should have a method called `prepare` that logs a message
   to the console with the taco's type, spiciness, and toppings.
5. Create a new instance of the `Taco` class and add two toppings to it using
   the `addTopping` method.
6. Call the `prepare` method on the `Taco` instance to log the message to the
   console.
